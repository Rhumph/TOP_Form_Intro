# TOP_Form_Intro

In this project I will be creating a basic form page with basic functionality and styling.

I was going to incorporate JS to check the 'Password' and 'Confirm Password' fields aligned but I couldn't see an easy solution and though this may be more time efficient to revisit once I have gone over JS in a little more depth further along in the course.

I am focused on getting through this curriculum and into a job as quickly as possible and I feel revisitin this down the track would be the fastest option.
